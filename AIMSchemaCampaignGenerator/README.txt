AIM Schema Generator
====================

Generates the description of the Analytics Matrix and a given number of campaigns (triggers) and stores this description in a meta database. MySQl or Sqlite can be used as the meta db and the corresponding jars have to exist on the class path.

The code is in src while the other files contain examples (for sql, sqlite and campaigns as html).
